## 📜 Topics Covered
Throughout this semester, I covered the following **fundamental Java concepts**:

1. **Java Fundamentals** - Data types, variables, operators, input/output, type conversion.
2. **Selection Control Structures** - `if-else`, `switch-case` statements.
3. **Repetition Control Structures** - `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops.
4. **Mathematical, Character, and String Methods** - `Math` class functions, string manipulation.
5. **Methods and Recursion** - Defining methods, method overloading, recursion.
6. **1-D and 2-D Arrays** - Array declaration, initialization, multi-dimensional arrays.
7. **Exception Handling** - `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`.
8. **File Handling** - Reading and writing files in Java.
